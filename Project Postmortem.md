### Project Post Mortem

#### What went well in the project?

I learned a lot through this project! I became familiar with a more practical IDE, Google Collab, and learned how to install and work with libraries. I also got comfortable using code snippets and utilizing cloud hosting, which made setting up the project significantly easier. 

One of the most valuable takeaways was learning how to work with more complex libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe. It involved a lot of scanning through different documentation sources to find the right information. Additionally, I had the opportunity to explore AR/MR and how to interact with it physically, which is something I've wanted to experiment with for a long time. This project acted as a great stepping stone toward future AR/MR ideas I’d like to pursue.

#### What did not go well in the project?

I learned a lot about the importance of managing class time effectively, and how I can tend to be disorganized when my projects are loosely defined. Also, using Google Collab instead of a local option like VS Code presented challenges. Many OpenCV implementations didn’t work because I had to access the hardware in a roundabout way. Additionally, I couldn’t open windows with OpenCV since the project was browser-based, so I had to rely on JavaScript code that I didn’t fully understand.

#### If you were doing this project again, what would you do differently?

I would have built off tutorials from the beginning. I had this idea stuck in my head that tutorials were "cheating" instead of a necessary learning tool. When I eventually picked them up, my progress in the project increased significantly. I also would have moved on from certain parts of the project when I got stuck instead of spending too much time on specific sections.
